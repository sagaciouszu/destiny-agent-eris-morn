## What's Changed

- Multi-User Isolation and Persona Freshness are back in the audit, 20 to 22 suites.
- AGENTS states the caption caveat and points series counts at `series/agents.json`.
- Adopts the shared setup.sh and the stricter shared-helper guard.

## Verification

- `bash tests/master-audit.sh`: 22/22.
- `python3 tests/persona-freshness.py`: rc 0.
- `python3 lore/tests/conformance.py`: PASS.
