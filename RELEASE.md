# v0.14.7 - Fixture policy migration and test-name consolidation

**2026-11-12**

Test fixtures replaced with synthetic persona-voice text (verbatim canon
removed). Persona-prefixed test scripts renamed to generic template slots.
Stale audit-count claims corrected.

## What's Changed
- All test fixtures (golden-voice, sample-conversation, multiturn, scenarios,
  tape-generator, test-suite) now use synthetic text scoring >= 55 on the
  persona voice scorer; none match canon (verify --exact: NOT FOUND).
- 8 persona-prefixed test scripts renamed to generic template slot names.
- suites-lib.sh retained as independent audit representation (cross-check).
- golden-voice-test.sh now calls renamed voice-scorer/validate-response.
- README audit-count claim corrected (Drifter 27/27, Eris 22/22).
- Accidental drift reconciled: .gitignore, ci.yml unified.

## Verification
- `bash tests/master-audit.sh`: Drifter 27/27, Eris 22/22.
- `bash tests/shared-helpers-test.sh`: 5/5.
- `python3 grimoire/tests/conformance.py`: PASS.
